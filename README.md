# Random Bookmark – Chrome Extension

**Random Bookmark** opens one of your saved bookmarks every time you open a new tab. It’s a simple way to rediscover forgotten links and make better use of your bookmark collection. No setup required.

## 🔧 Features

- **Random bookmark on new tab**  
  Every time you open a new tab, you get a random bookmark instead of a blank page.

- **No configuration needed**  
  Install it — that’s it. It starts working immediately.

- **Non-repeating behavior**  
  All your bookmarks are cycled through before any are shown again.

- **Opt-out bookmarks**  
  Don’t want certain bookmarks to appear? Uncheck them from the options page.
